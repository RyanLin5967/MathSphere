# CS50_final_project
TODO:
- When the user is logged in, the main screen should not show the Register/login buttons anymore. It should show a logout one or something
- Somehow use jinja to make the layout the layout
- Make login and register logic (registering and logging in should be required before showing other functions)
Do this for now
